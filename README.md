# Alien-Invasion
# Developed during a intro to programming course utilizing Python Crash Course 2nd edition

# if 'import pygame' throws an error, open a terminal instance and run:
  # > pip install pygame
# This will then allow you to run the main alien_invasion.py file. 

# When run, python will open a seperate window that will have your game in it. 

# Program runs a basic game where alien ships approach your spaceship. By using the arrow keys you move your spaceship left and right and can fire bullets with the space bar.
